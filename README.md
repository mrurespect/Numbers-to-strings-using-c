# Numbers-to-strings-using-c
This project is about converting Numbers to strings for exemple :for the number "0" the output will be "zero" ;this project is very helpful and include using string and  file operating .
the maximum is 999 milliads 999 million 999 milles 999
this project may contains the file "FR_0"
its possible to use a file by your choice just remember that the output will be different so handle  errors or just use the main file "FR_0";
the idea of this project is the next :
- we read the input as string
- we split the input as two string separating by the comma "," if exist
- if the size of the string at left or right of the comma are less than 9 we convert it to int then we extract the values from the file
- if not we split last string to two sub string with the lenght of right one is 9 
- reading from the file with handling all of the case use Recursive function
- the choice of 9 is to not depasse the maximum of an int variable :2147483647 so we use just millions
